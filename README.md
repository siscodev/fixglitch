# fixglitch
An applet to fix an alignment issue with the menu in linux mint

For some reason when setting the primary panel to it's minimum height, the left side placement
for icons and the menu get cut in half. 

By adding a seperator before the menu the problem resolves itself.  However doing this means that you have to click on
the menu to open it versus quickly moving your cursor to the bottom left corner and clicking. 

FixGlitch works by inserting an applet in the corner which is only visible while the panel is in edit mode.
When panel edit mode is turned off, the lime green block has its styles; and size removed.  This fixes both problems.

When the panel is not in edit mode, you will not be able to move the fixglitch applet, the panel HAS TO BE IN EDIT MODE.

There are some preview images to show what Im talking about.
